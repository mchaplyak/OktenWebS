                <img src="img/sheldon.jpg" alt="Sheldon Cooper">
                <p>
                    Originally from Galveston, Texas, Sheldon was a child prodigy with an eidetic memory who began college at the age of eleven, and earned a PhD at age sixteen. 
                    He is a theoretical physicist researching quantum mechanics and string theory, and despite his IQ of 187, he finds many routine aspects of social situations difficult to grasp. 
                    He is determined to have his own way, continually boasts of his intelligence, and has an extremely ritualized way of living. Despite these quirks, he begins a relationship with 
                    Amy Farrah Fowler, and they eventually marry.

                <p>
                    An aspiring actress from Omaha, Nebraska. Penny moves in across the hall from Sheldon and Leonard. She waits tables and occasionally tends the bar at The Cheesecake Factory. 
                    After giving up hope of becoming a successful actress, Penny becomes a pharmaceutical sales representative. Penny becomes friends with Bernadette and Amy, 
                    and they often hang out in each other's apartments. Penny and Leonard form a relationship and eventually marry.

                <img src="img/howard.jpg" alt="Howard Wolowitz">
                <p>
                    An aerospace engineer who got his Masters at MIT. Howard is Jewish and lived with his mother, Debbie (Carol Ann Susi). Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, Bernadette and Amy, 
                    Howard does not hold a doctorate. He goes into space, training as an astronaut and serving as a payload specialist. Howard initially fancies himself as a womanizer, 
                    but he later starts dating Bernadette, and they get engaged and married. Howard also has a tendency to waste money on toys and argues with Bernadette because 
                    of his oddly low income as an engineer and her high income as a pharmaceutical biochemist.

                <hr><h3>Kunal Nayyar as Rajesh Koothrappali</h3>

                    A particle astrophysicist originally from New Delhi, India. Raj is initially unable to talk to women unless he drinks alcohol. Raj also has very feminine tastes and often 
                    takes on a stereotypical female role in his friendship with Howard as well as in the group of four men. Raj later dates Lucy (Kate Micucci), who also suffers from social 
                    anxiety, but it eventually ends; he later speaks to Penny without alcohol and thus overcomes his selective mutism. He begins dating Emily and their relationship later becomes exclusive. Raj also has a Yorkshire Terrier named Cinnamon.

                    Although generally a sweet and good-natured person, Bernadette has a short fuse and can be vindictive and lash out when provoked.
